Some classic problems:

  1. Shortest Path Problem (SPP): Find shortest path between two nodes. --> Polynomial

  2. Bipartite Matching Problem (BMP二分图): Find the pairing with minimum cost. --> Polynomial

  3. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST最小生成树): Find the spanning tree of minimum weight. -->Polynomial

  4. knapsack/Bin Packing problem (背包问题): Choose items to give the maximum value within a given capacity. --> Easy NP(between polynomial and NP hard)

  5. Jobshop Scheduling: Schedule jobs on machines to minimize total time. 

  6. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): find the tour of minimum cost that visits all cities. --> NP Hard

  7. Vehicle Routing problem (VRP): Given a set of customers, and a fleet of vehicles to make deliveries, find a set of toutes that servies all customers at minimum cost. --> NP Hard

Combinatorial Optimisation Problems (COP):

  Find the best object in the finite obiects set. The characteristic of COP: the the set of feasible solutions is discrete or can be simplified to discrete, and the goal is to find 
  
  the optimal solution. TSP abd MST are combinatorial problems, in fact, it is difficult to enumeration method to solve these problems when the objects set is large.
